As you have realized, these boards are a bit magical, we can drop in a cell as many stones as we wish:
2, 4, 12, 50, 1000. There is no limit!

There is something really interesting that happens when programming: we can work with numbers as big as we wish.

> Well, now it is your turn: write a program that drops four red stones and three black stones in the current cell.
