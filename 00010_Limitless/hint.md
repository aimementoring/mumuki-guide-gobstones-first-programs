Notice that we didn't tell you how is the board on which we will execute this program, or where the head is. And that is becauseâ€¦it doesn't matter!

If your program is well written, and solves the problem of dropping four red stones and three black stones in the current cell, it can work for **any board**.

Anyway, only once and as help, we will show you the board on which the program will be executed:

<gs-board>
  GBB/1.0
    size 3 3
    head 0 0
</gs-board>
