As you can imagine, not only the head can be moved to the north, and a program can combine any kind of movements.

> Write a program that moves the head two positions to the East and one to the South, resulting in the following effect:

<table class= "table" style="width:100%">
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center">Inicial</th>
    <th style="text-align: center"></th> 
    <th style="text-align: center">Final</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center">  
      <gs-board>
        GBB/1.0
        size 3 3
        head 0 2
      </gs-board>
    </td>
    <td style="text-align: center"><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i></td> 
    <td style="text-align: center">
      <gs-board>
        GBB/1.0
        size 3 3
        head 2 1
      </gs-board>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tbody>
</table>
 
Remember that the command which moves the head is called Move (neither mOvE or move or MOVE). **It's very important to observe the syntax!** If you don't do it, the program won't work.
