**BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!** :bomb: :bomb: :bomb:

_Hey, what happened?_ <br>
Your program failed, it broke, or what we say in the Gobstones universe: it made BOOM.

_So, what does it mean?_ <br>
That the commands you gave to the computer can not be executed, and there is something you must change in order for the program to work.

In this exercise, it doesn't make sense to change anything, since we did it on purpose. However, take this into account when making mistakes in the future.
