Although programming seems to be an exact science, it is **the art of making the computer solve our problems**.

One moment…¿art? :scream: Yes! There are many ways of solving a problem, and finding those ways is a creative process :bulb:. The result of this process is a _program_: a description of the solution to the problem, which can be _executed_ by the computer.

Knowing how to program gives us a big power: instead of doing repetitive and boring tasks, **we will use our knowledge and imagination to make them automatic** (fortunately, the computer doesn't get bored).

However, how do we explain to the computer how to solve a problem? We need to write the solution in a language that both people and computers can understand: _programming language_.

Let's learn how to do it with the help of Gobstones language!
