Although programming seems to be an exact science, **programming is the art of making a computer solve our problems**.
 
Wait… art? Yes! There are many ways of solving a problem, and finding those ways is a creative process.
 
The result of this process is a _program_: a description of the solution to the problem which can be _executed_ by a computer. 

Knowing how to program gives us a big power: instead of doing repetitive and boring tasks, **we will use our knowledge and imagination to automate them** (fortunately, computers don't get bored).
 
But, how do we explain to the computer how to solve the problem? We need to write the solution in a language that both people and computers can understand: **a programming language**.
 
Let’s learn how to do that with the help of Gobstones language!
