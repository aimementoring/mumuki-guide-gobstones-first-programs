To begin programming, the first element we will use is a square board, similar to the one that is used to play Chess, Checkers or [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)).
 
These boards can have any size, such as: 

| 4x4 | 3x2 |
|:---:|:---:|
|![4x4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sagrado-corazon-alcal/mumuki-fundamentos-gobstones-guia-1-primeros-programas/master/4x4.png)|![3x2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sagrado-corazon-alcal/mumuki-fundamentos-gobstones-guia-1-primeros-programas/master/3x2.png)|
 
We will always need a board (which we'll create on each of these exercises for you) to **execute** our **programs** on.
The interesting point is that the same program can be executed on different boards, bringing about different results.
 
> In order for you to check that we don't lie, press the “Continue” button, and we will generate your first 3x3 board.
