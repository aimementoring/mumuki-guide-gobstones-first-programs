Let's understand what we just did: write a program.

Every program has exactly one `program` block: a section of the code which declares the commands (actions) that we want the computer to execute on the initial board. By executing a program, we get a final board.

The syntax of a `program` is really simple:

1. we write a line which says `program`, followed by an opening key: `{`
1. next, the commands: one per line
1. and finally, one last key which closes the one we used before `}`

Some examples of `program`s:

```gobstones
program {
}
```

(does nothing)

```gobstones
program {
  Move(North)
}
```

(moves the head one position to the north)

```gobstones
program {
  Move(North)
  Move(North)
}
```

(moves the head two positions to the north)
 
> Knowing this, write a program which, on a 2x4 board with the head in the initial point (the left bottom cell), moves the head three times to the north.
