In the same way that there is a “drop a stone” (Drop), there is a “grab a stone” (Grab), which removes exactly one stone of the given color.

For example, the following program grabs two stones from the initial position.

```gobstones
program {
  Grab(Red)
  Grab(Red)
}
```

> Knowing this, write a program which removes only the small red stone in this board. Watch out! Pay attention to the position of the head. : wink:
